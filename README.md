Marine species 


A data-driven approach to understanding marine species using aquamaps.org data and machine learning

Project Overview : 

This project aims to collect, integrate, and analyze environmental data for a wide range of marine species (2000~2500 species). The core objective is to investigate ecological patterns by linking environmental variables and observations (such as temperature, salinity, probability of habitat etc.. ) with marine species occurrence data.

The project involves:

- Web scraping environmental and species data from AquaMaps.org ( Environmental data + Complete DataSet where the records of the observations can be found )

- Combining this scraped data with an existing dataset provided by the Faculty of Bioengineering at Ghent University

- Analyzing the resulting dataset using visualization techniques and machine learning models

- Identifying meaningful correlations and ecological insights based on environmental parameters
  
- Visualisation through different graphs, curves and maps. 


This project is conducted over a 3-month period, under the academic guidance of a postdoctoral researcher from Ghent University.
